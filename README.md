## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Python Dependencies

```bash
cd d:\club\fyweb
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Initialize Database

```bash
python init_db.py
```

This creates:
- Default admin account: `admin` / `admin123`
- Database tables
- Default exam settings (30 min, 10 questions)

### 3. Start Both Servers

**Terminal 1 - Student Portal:**
```bash
python app.py
```
Runs on: `http://0.0.0.0:5000`

**Terminal 2 - Admin Panel:**
```bash
python admin_app.py
```
Runs on: `http://0.0.0.0:5001`

### 4. Find Your Local IP Address

**Windows:**
```bash
ipconfig
```
Look for "IPv4 Address" (e.g., `192.168.1.100`)

**Linux/Mac:**
```bash
ifconfig
```

### 5. Access URLs

**For Students:**
```
http://<YOUR_IP>:5000
Example: http://192.168.1.100:5000
```

**For Admin:**
```
http://<YOUR_IP>:5001
Example: http://192.168.1.100:5001

## 🌐 Network Configuration

### For ~50 Concurrent Users

1. **Use a good Wi-Fi router** (supports 50+ devices)
2. **Host laptop requirements:**
   - Stable power supply
   - Good Wi-Fi connection
   - At least 4GB RAM
   - Windows/Linux/Mac

3. **Firewall settings:**
   - Allow incoming connections on ports 5000 and 5001
   - Windows: `Windows Defender Firewall > Allow an app`

### Testing Connection

From any student device:
```bash
ping <HOST_IP>
```

If ping works, students can access the exam.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Students can't connect
- Check firewall settings
- Verify all devices on same network
- Confirm host IP address is correct
- Ensure both Flask apps are running

### "Not enough questions" error
- Admin must add questions ≥ questions_per_exam setting

### Student already attempted
- This is by design (one attempt only)
- Admin can delete and recreate student account if needed

### Timer not working
- Ensure JavaScript is enabled in browser
- Check browser console for errors

## 📊 Performance Tips

- Close unnecessary applications on host laptop
- Use wired connection for host if possible
- Test with 5-10 students before full deployment
- Keep question bank reasonable (50-100 questions)

## 🔄 Resetting the System

**Reset all student attempts:**
```sql
sqlite3 exam.db "UPDATE users SET attempted = 0 WHERE role = 'student'"
```

**Clear all results:**
```sql
sqlite3 exam.db "DELETE FROM results; DELETE FROM answers;"
```

**Complete reset:**
```bash
del exam.db
python init_db.py
```
